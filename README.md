## My Teenage Projects 🍼
> I have been programming as a hobby since primary school, that means I've been programming for more than 10 years now. 
> I have created many hobby projects when I was a kid and later in my teenage years, most of them are lost unfortunately because I didn't know of Git back then, I managed to recover some of them here, RIP to the lost projects
